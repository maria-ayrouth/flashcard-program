# flashcard-program


this prog is especially great with studying for languages.
it shows you the front and the back of the card . after three seconds the card flips and i can check whether if i knew the right answer , if i got right i'll press the tick and if i got it wrong i'll press the cross .
when i click the ckeck mark , the flashcard it's going to be out of all of the list of flashcards so it doesn't show me the things i already know , and instead it only shows me the things i don't know so i can review it.
